## Grocery-Shopper-Analysis

### We were given a dataset of a top tier grocery chain. We had to analyse the behaviours of different shoppers during different periods of time.

### I was responsible to answer the following questions to help analyze the behaviour of grocery shoppers

### Data Analyzing
  * Store shopping trips are recorded in your database?  
  * Households appear in your database?
  * Stores of different retailers appear in our data base?
  * Products per category and products per module?
  * Total transactions and transactions realized under some kind of promotion?
  * Demographics remarkably different? Are these people richer? Poorer?
  * What is the retailer that has more loyalists?
  * Where do they live? Plot the distribution by state.

### Visualizations
  * Average number of items purchased on a given month.
  * Average number of shopping trips per month.
  * Average number of days between 2 consecutive shopping trips.
  * Is the number of shopping trips per month correlated with the average number of items purchased?
  * Is the average price paid per item correlated with the number of items purchased?
  * Distribution of products and modules per department
