# Grocery-Shopper-Analysis

## We were given a dataset of a top tier grocery chain. We had to analyse the behaviours of different shoppers during different periods of time.

## Softwares Used-Python, SQL


## I was responsible to answer the following questions to help analyze the behaviour of grocery shoppers

## Data Analyzing
  1. Store shopping trips are recorded in your database?  
  2. Households appear in your database?
  3. Stores of different retailers appear in our data base?
  4. Products per category and products per module?
  5. Total transactions and transactions realized under some kind of promotion?
  6. Demographics remarkably different? Are these people richer? Poorer?
  7. What is the retailer that has more loyalists?
  8. Where do they live? Plot the distribution by state.

## Visualizations
  1. Average number of items purchased on a given month.
  2. Average number of shopping trips per month.
  3. Average number of days between 2 consecutive shopping trips.
  4. Is the number of shopping trips per month correlated with the average number of items purchased?
  5. Is the average price paid per item correlated with the number of items purchased?
  6. Distribution of products and modules per department
